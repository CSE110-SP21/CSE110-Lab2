        <h1>Tuesday (4/6/21) Journal</h1>
        <h3>Things that needed to be done based on priority:</h3>
        </header>
        <ol>
                <li>Doing HW for CSE 101</li>
                <li>Attending office hours for CSE 101</li>
                <li>Watching recorded lecture for CSE 110 and ECE 45</li>
                <li>Relaxing for some time</li>
        </ol>

        

        <h3>Things I need to remeber for my ECE 45 Class:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Practice the new formula introduced for Bode Plots</li>
            <li>Try to remeber the procedure for solving linear circuits</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Getting off my chest:<br>
            My CSE 101 is challenging and the more I try to understand what is going on in that class, the more I get confused.<br>
            I think the only way to pass this class is to go to the prof's office hours so that I can clarify any misunderstanding
            that I might have about graphs, the topic that we are covering this week.

        <p>A picture of my favorite car that I came across on this date:</p>
