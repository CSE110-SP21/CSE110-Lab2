        <h3>Things I need to remeber for my ECE 45 Class:</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>Practice the new formula introduced for Bode Plots</li>
            <li>Try to remeber the procedure for solving linear circuits</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="Important Note">
        <p>Getting off my chest:<br>
            My CSE 101 is challenging and the more I try to understand what is going on in that class, the more I get confused.<br>
            I think the only way to pass this class is to go to the prof's office hours so that I can clarify any misunderstanding
            that I might have about graphs, the topic that we are covering this week.
